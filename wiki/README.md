# Welcome Cardio Lab

This wiki presents the design, development, and validation of an innovative in-vitro pulsatile flow system, the Thrombogenicity Tester (TGT), to evaluate blood clot formation near bi-leaflet mechanical heart valves (MHVs).&#x20;

The device replicates physiological cardiac flow conditions with enhanced accuracy, utilizing hemo-compatible materials and precise motor control mechanisms to prevent unintended thrombosis within the experimental setup. Validation is conducted through flow dynamics testing and comparative analysis against established physiological flow benchmarks. Results will show if the TGT provides a reliable and physiologically representative platform for studying thrombus formation.&#x20;

The ultimate objective of this research is to contribute to reducing patient dependency on lifelong anticoagulant therapy and the associated risks, thereby improving the quality of life for patients with MHVs.
