# Initial Literature Review for ML Based Audio Clot Detection

### I. Introduction

The detection of early thrombosis development in mechanical heart valves (MHVs) is a critical problem in both clinical and experimental domains, and our research study employs a blood-filled loop equipped with a mechanical heart valve to replicate pulsatile blood flow, with a sensitive microphone positioned near the valve to capture its unique closure "click" sound (Ahn & Yeo, 2021). Our experimental hypothesis—that the valve’s closure acoustics become noticeably duller as thrombogenesis progresses—has been confirmed repeatedly over 45-minute blood flow experiments, and we now aim to adapt audio-based machine learning techniques for real-time thrombosis detection (Kara & Herdem, 2010). The primary motivation behind our study is to develop a system that can automatically halt the simulation the instant an atypical acoustic signature is detected, thereby pinpointing the earliest signs of clot formation on the mechanical valve (Altunkaya & İnan, 2019). Real-time detection is crucial not only to inform potential therapeutic interventions but also to enhance our understanding of the dynamic changes in valve acoustics under pathological conditions (Dwivedi, Imtiaz, & Rodriguez-Villegas, 2019).

### II. Background and Related Work

Audio anomaly detection has been explored in a variety of engineering and biomedical contexts, and numerous studies have demonstrated that the fusion of signal processing with machine learning is effective for identifying subtle deviations in acoustic patterns (Ahn & Yeo, 2021). In mechanical systems, advanced anomaly detection methodologies that leverage deep learning architectures—such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)—have achieved high accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal operational states even when anomalies are rare (Ahn & Yeo, 2021). Likewise, in the biomedical domain, researchers have applied audio signal analysis to heart sounds for the classification of valvular diseases using techniques like time-frequency analysis, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and advanced spectral feature extraction methods (Dwivedi et al., 2019). Studies have also utilized statistical measures such as skewness and kurtosis of the first heart sound (S1) to differentiate between normally functioning valves and those affected by thrombosis, with skewness emerging as one of the most sensitive indicators (Kara & Herdem, 2010). Furthermore, research on implantable devices—such as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs)—has shown promise in using acoustic features coupled with conventional classifiers (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines) for the detection of thrombosis, suggesting that similar audio-based approaches could be adapted to the MHV domain (Semiz et al., 2020).

### III. Audio Feature Extraction and Signal Processing

A robust detection framework based on valve closure acoustics must begin with preprocessing the raw audio signals to minimize ambient noise and omnipresent artifacts. One effective approach is to implement advanced noise reduction methods based on wavelet denoising and high-pass filtering to eliminate low-frequency artifacts that may arise from blood flow or environmental interference (Emmanuel, 2012). Following noise reduction, segmentation is a critical step that involves isolating individual valve closure events from the continuous audio recording. Techniques such as envelope extraction and autocorrelation-based segmentation have been successfully employed in phonocardiographic systems to delineate the S1 and S2 heart sounds, and analogous methods can be adapted to isolate the sharp "click" events of the mechanical valve (Kao & Wei, 2011). After segmentation, feature extraction plays a central role, with the objective of representing each click in a lower-dimensional feature space that captures both its temporal and spectral characteristics. Hand-engineered features—such as time-domain characteristics (e.g., click duration, peak amplitude) and statistical descriptors (e.g., skewness and kurtosis)—have been shown to be particularly effective at capturing changes in valve acoustics due to thrombosis (Kara & Herdem, 2010; Altunkaya et al., 2011). In addition, frequency-domain features can be derived through short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or wavelet transforms, which reveal spectral peaks and shifts in frequency content that occur as the acoustic signature dulls with clot formation (Emmanuel, 2012; Famaey et al., 2010). Recent advances also include the extraction of mel-spectrogram or deep spectrum features, wherein the raw audio is converted into a time-frequency image suitable for deep learning models such as CNNs (Zhou et al., 2023).

### IV. Machine Learning Methodologies for Anomaly Detection

Once features are extracted from the valve closure sounds, supervised and unsupervised machine learning models can be applied to detect anomalies indicative of thrombosis onset. Supervised models such as support vector machines (SVMs) have been used extensively in the classification of abnormal heart sounds, leveraging labeled datasets to distinguish between normal and pathological conditions (Kara & Herdem, 2010; Semiz et al., 2020). One effective methodology is to train the classifier on a dataset generated from the 45-minute experiments, where each valve click is annotated as either normal or exhibiting signs of early thrombus formation. Dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) are essential in this context to reduce the computational complexity and improve the classifier’s generalization by eliminating redundant features (Hefft & Alberini, 2020). Alternatively, unsupervised anomaly detection approaches can be considered when abnormal samples are relatively scarce. In this context, autoencoders—a form of neural network trained to reproduce the input signal—can be utilized, where the reconstruction error serves as an anomaly score. A valve click that deviates from the normal pattern will generate a high reconstruction error, thereby signaling the occurrence of thrombosis (Ahn & Yeo, 2021; Fernando et al., 2021). Moreover, hybrid architectures such as convolutional long short-term memory networks (ConvLSTM), which combine convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction with LSTM cells for temporal dependencies, hold promise in capturing the sequential nature of valve closure events over time (Ahn & Yeo, 2021).

### V. Candidate System Architecture for Real-Time Detection

In developing a real-time thrombosis detection system based on MHV closure acoustics, the overall system design can be broadly divided into three modules: data acquisition, feature extraction, and anomaly detection. Data acquisition involves capturing high-fidelity audio data through a strategically placed sensitive microphone and interfacing it with a digital signal processor (DSP) capable of real-time operation (Huang et al., 2023). The DSP performs initial noise filtering and segmentation of the valve clicks, which are then forwarded to the feature extraction module. This module leverages a combination of traditional signal processing approaches—such as STFT, wavelet transforms, and statistical analysis—as well as possibly deep feature extraction methods, if the computational hardware permits, to represent each click in terms of its temporal, statistical, and spectral features (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Kara & Herdem, 2010). Following feature extraction, the processed signals are fed into an anomaly detection module, which implements a trained classifier (e.g., SVM, deep CNN, or autoencoder-based model) that continuously monitors the incoming data stream (Semiz et al., 2020). The module is designed to compare the current acoustic state of the valve against a baseline profile established under normal operation conditions. When the classifier detects a significant deviation—implying a dulling of the valve’s click—it triggers an immediate alert or stops the simulation to allow for detailed investigation (Teng, 2019). This real-time feedback mechanism is essential for the timely identification and potential mitigation of thrombogenic events which might otherwise lead to catastrophic clinical outcomes (Ren et al., 2024).

### VI. Data Collection and Dataset Preparation

The success of any machine learning model is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of the training dataset. Given that our experimental setup records 45-minute sessions of valve click data, it is possible to generate an extensive and diverse dataset capturing a range of acoustical features as thrombosis develops. The dataset should include labeled examples of valve clicks at various stages—from normal to early and advanced thrombosis—to ensure that supervised learning models can learn the full spectrum of acoustic variations (Kara & Herdem, 2010). Data augmentation techniques, common in audio signal processing, can also be applied to enrich the dataset and improve model robustness, especially when the amount of abnormal data is limited. Such techniques may involve adding minor artificial variations (e.g., time shifts, noise injection) to simulate variability in experimental or even clinical settings (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Milling et al., 2022). Moreover, splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets under realistic conditions (for example, using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation) is imperative to minimize overfitting and to accurately estimate the model’s generalization capabilities (Hefft & Alberini, 2020).

### VII. Potential Machine Learning Models and Their Adaptability

Several machine learning models have been identified as promising candidates for the task of thrombosis detection based on valve closure acoustics. Support vector machines (SVMs) are favored in scenarios where annotated datasets are of moderate size because of their robustness to high-dimensional feature spaces and limited training samples (Kara & Herdem, 2010; Semiz et al., 2020). In our context, SVM classifiers could be trained on carefully engineered features such as statistical moments (skewness, kurtosis) and spectral peak values, which have been shown to fluctuate significantly with the onset of thrombosis (Altunkaya & İnan, 2019). Deep learning models, including one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), provide an appealing alternative if large volumes of data are available. These models can automatically extract hierarchical features from raw audio signals and have been successful in various biomedical applications such as heart sound analysis and lung sound classification (Huang et al., 2023; Dwivedi et al., 2019). Moreover, unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, particularly autoencoders, can be trained solely on normal valve closure sounds to develop a baseline profile, with subsequent deviations flagged as possible thrombotic events (Fernando et al., 2021; Ahn & Yeo, 2021). Hybrid architectures that combine elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning, such as semi-supervised autoencoder classifiers, may further enhance detection accuracy when labeled data is sparse (Ahn & Yeo, 2021).

### VIII. Integration of Audio Anomaly Detection Approaches from Diverse Domains

While our primary application pertains to detecting thrombosis in mechanical heart valves, methodology from related fields offers valuable insights that can be adapted to our needs. For example, in the context of left ventricular assist device pump thrombosis, acoustic analysis methods based on extracting multi-dimensional features and correlating them with clinical biomarkers have achieved high detection accuracy (Semiz et al., 2020). Similarly, research on pipe obstruction detection using passive acoustic emission sensors and supervised machine learning has demonstrated that dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis (PCA) followed by SVM classification yields impressive accuracy when detecting faults in dynamic systems (Hefft & Alberini, 2020). The underlying principle in all these applications—namely, the recognition of subtle acoustic anomalies from within a continuous data stream—resonates well with the goal of detecting early thrombosis in MHVs. Audio-based anomaly detection frameworks, such as those developed for general heart sound analysis and speech pathology, rely on converting one-dimensional audio signals into two-dimensional representations (e.g., spectrograms, mel-spectrograms) that are then processed using deep CNNs to capture spatio-temporal patterns (Zhou et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2024). The adaptation of these techniques to valve closure sounds involves similar steps, where preprocessed recordings of valve clicks are transformed into enriched representations that highlight minor deviations in frequency content and temporal structure associated with thrombogenesis (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Milling et al., 2022).

### IX. Challenges and Considerations for Real-Time Implementation

Several practical challenges must be addressed when designing a system for real-time thrombosis detection based on acoustic signals from mechanical heart valves. First, the operating environment is inherently noisy due to turbulent blood flow and mechanical vibrations, which necessitates advanced noise filtering and robust segmentation algorithms that can accurately isolate valve closure clicks from the continuous audio stream (Emmanuel, 2012; Famaey et al., 2010). Second, the variability in acoustic signals due to patient-specific factors or even minor differences in the experimental setup can affect the consistency of feature extraction, requiring adaptive and possibly online recalibration techniques to maintain detection accuracy (Dwivedi et al., 2019). Third, the computational complexity of real-time deep learning models poses a challenge in a laboratory or clinical setting, and thus the selected models must be optimized for low-latency processing on potentially limited hardware resources (Milling et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2024). Furthermore, the integration of uncertainty quantification and explainability into the machine learning framework is vital, as clinicians require insight into why a particular valve click was categorized as abnormal, thus facilitating clinical confidence in the technology (Fernando et al., 2021). To address these issues, a hybrid approach may be recommended, beginning with simpler machine learning models such as SVMs trained on a carefully curated, hand-engineered feature set, with the option to upgrade to more computationally intensive deep networks as data volume increases (Kara & Herdem, 2010; Semiz et al., 2020).

### X. Proposed Experimental Validation and Future Research Directions

The next phase of our research should focus on the systematic collection and labeling of an extensive valve click dataset under controlled experimental conditions. This dataset will provide the foundation for training, validating, and testing multiple machine learning models to determine the most effective approach for real-time thrombosis detection (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Teng, 2019). A phased experimental design is recommended. Initially, experiments should capture baseline recordings of valve closure acoustics under normal conditions and during artificially induced early thrombosis. Feature extraction methods will then be benchmarked, comparing traditional statistical features, such as skewness and kurtosis (Kara & Herdem, 2010), with time-frequency representations like mel-spectrograms and wavelet transforms (Emmanuel, 2012; Dwivedi et al., 2019). In parallel, simple classifiers such as SVMs and logistic regression models should be trained to establish baseline performance metrics, and their parameters optimized using cross-validation strategies employed in related studies (Semiz et al., 2020; Hefft & Alberini, 2020). Following these initial evaluations, more advanced deep learning architectures—including 1D CNNs, RNNs, and ConvLSTM networks—should be explored to assess whether automated feature learning can capture subtle acoustic deviations more effectively than hand-engineered features (Ahn & Yeo, 2021; Dwivedi et al., 2019). Furthermore, the implementation of autoencoder-based unsupervised anomaly detectors should be pursued to evaluate their ability to flag anomalous valve clicks based solely on reconstruction errors, a strategy that may be particularly useful when abnormal data is scarce (Fernando et al., 2021).

Once the models are trained, an integrated real-time processing pipeline must be developed wherein continuous audio is acquired, processed, and analyzed with minimal latency. This includes designing a system that performs on-the-fly segmentation, feature extraction, and classification while simultaneously providing feedback to the operator—such as halting the blood loop experiment when early signs of thrombosis are detected (Teng, 2019; Ren et al., 2024). Future research directions include the exploration of multimodal data fusion, where additional sensors—such as accelerometers or pressure transducers—could be integrated with acoustic data to further improve detection robustness. Moreover, the development of standardized protocols for acoustic data collection in both experimental and clinical settings will be crucial to enable the transfer of our findings from the laboratory to practical, real-world applications (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Milling et al., 2022).

Furthermore, interpretability remains an important future research avenue. Techniques such as model agnostic explainability methods or attention mechanisms in deep neural networks could be implemented to provide insights into the specific features or segments of the valve clicks that drive the anomaly detection decision (Milling et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2024). This interpretability will enhance trust among clinical users and facilitate the iterative refinement of detection algorithms based on expert feedback.

### XI. Discussion

The feasibility of employing audio-based anomaly detection for real-time thrombosis monitoring in MHVs is supported by a converging body of research spanning biomedical signal processing, machine learning-based heart sound analysis, and automotive or pump fault detection in engineering. Our review of the literature indicates that both traditional approaches—such as statistical analysis of temporal features (e.g., skewness of the S1 heart sound)—and advanced deep learning methods are likely to play a significant role in the ultimate detection pipeline (Kara & Herdem, 2010; Ahn & Yeo, 2021). Moreover, our proposal echoes successful strategies from LVAD pump thrombosis detection systems, which have successfully combined a robust set of acoustical features with supervised classifiers to achieve high detection accuracy (Semiz et al., 2020).

A key advantage of employing an acoustic-based methodology is its non-invasive nature and relative cost-effectiveness compared to imaging techniques such as echocardiography. Furthermore, since mechanical heart valves produce highly reproducible closure sounds under normal conditions, deviations from the established acoustic baseline can serve as reliable indicators of abnormal valve function and early thrombosis (Altunkaya & İnan, 2019; Famaey et al., 2010). The high temporal resolution of audio recordings—capturing each valve click in real time—further supports the viability of prompt detection and intervention (Dwivedi et al., 2019).

However, several challenges must be surmounted for successful implementation. Variability in acoustic recordings due to differences in microphone placement, experimental conditions, or patient-specific factors necessitates robust adaptive algorithms that can normalize across such variability (Emmanuel, 2012; Dwivedi et al., 2019). Moreover, small changes in the "click" sound, which may be subtle in the early stages of thrombosis, require a high signal-to-noise ratio and precise feature extraction methods. The integration of deep learning techniques with traditional signal processing may provide the best of both worlds by allowing for automated feature learning while still benefiting from the interpretability of engineered statistical measures (Milling et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2024).

Finally, given that our current study is conducted in a controlled laboratory environment, future work should explore the translation of these techniques to in vivo settings, where additional complexities such as tissue attenuation, ambient noise, and patient movement become significant factors. The lessons learned and methodologies developed from our blood loop experiments will serve as a strong foundation for these future clinical applications (Zhou et al., 2023; Altunkaya & İnan, 2019).

### XII. Conclusion

In summary, our research study on a blood-filled loop simulation with a mechanical heart valve has provided compelling evidence that changes in the valve’s closure acoustics—most notably a dulling of the characteristic “click”—are strongly indicative of thrombosis onset. To harness this phenomenon for real-time detection, we propose a multi-faceted methodology that combines advanced noise filtering, precise segmentation, and robust feature extraction with both traditional and deep learning-based anomaly detection approaches (Ahn & Yeo, 2021; Kara & Herdem, 2010). The integration of supervised classifiers such as SVMs with unsupervised techniques like autoencoders, bolstered by modern deep learning architectures capable of processing raw or spectrogram-transformed audio data, appears to be a promising pathway toward achieving early, automated detection of thrombus formation on MHVs (Semiz et al., 2020; Dwivedi et al., 2019).

Moreover, our review of relevant literature—from heart sound analysis in clinical diagnosis to acoustic anomaly detection in engineering systems—demonstrates that numerous established methodologies are adaptable to our specific challenge (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2024). Future work will focus on refining the feature extraction and classification pipelines, expanding the labeled dataset through extensive experimentation, and optimizing the processing pipeline for real-time deployment in both laboratory and eventual clinical settings (Teng, 2019; Milling et al., 2022).

Through these efforts, we expect to develop a robust, interpretable, and efficient system that leverages the subtle nuances of valve closure acoustics to provide early warnings of thrombosis development, thereby potentially enabling timely clinical intervention and improved patient outcomes (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Semiz et al., 2020). This research not only deepens our understanding of the acoustic signatures associated with pathological changes in MHVs but also paves the way for the broader application of audio-based anomaly detection methods in biomedical engineering and non-invasive continuous health monitoring (Milling et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2024).
