# Future Improvements and Possible Project/Research goals.

## System Improvements&#x20;

* The future of TGT at Cardio Lab of San Jose State University aims to contribute to the twin system along side the MCL.
* TGT successfully implemented MHV placement, pulsatile flow, and thrombosis capture.
* Improve TGT with better motor control algorithms and sinusoidal acceleration profiles.
* Enhance TGT design, material selection, and experimental protocols.
* Use a rigid PMMA tube to eliminate kinks and reduce material contact with blood.
* Mandate blood bags for storing and delivering blood to reduce air exposure.\


## Real Time Clot Detection Using Machine Learning&#x20;

* Collect, denoise, and label a large dataset of valve click sounds at various thrombosis stages.
* Benchmark feature extraction methods, including statistical, time-frequency, and deep features.
* Explore deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, ConvLSTM) for automated feature learning.
* Train chosen model/s&#x20;
* Test detection efficacy
* Explore real time capture methods
* Implementation and testing.
