# In Vitro Pulsatile Flow Thrombogenicity Tester for Mechanical Heart Valves

A specialized testing apparatus designed to evaluate the thrombogenic potential of mechanical heart valves under pulsatile flow conditions. This project aims to provide a controlled in vitro environment for assessing the blood-material interactions and potential thrombosis risks in mechanical heart valve designs.

## Project Overview

The Pulsatile Flow Tester is designed to:

- Simulate physiological flow conditions through mechanical heart valves
- Evaluate thrombogenicity under controlled conditions
- Measure and analyze flow dynamics
- Assess blood-material interface interactions
- Provide quantitative data for valve performance analysis
