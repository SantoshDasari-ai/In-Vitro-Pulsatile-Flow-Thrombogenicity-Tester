# In Vitro Pulsatile Flow Thrombogenicity Tester for Mechanical Heart Valves

A specialized testing apparatus designed to evaluate the thrombogenic potential of mechanical heart valves under pulsatile flow conditions. This project aims to provide a controlled in vitro environment for assessing the blood-material interactions and potential thrombosis risks in mechanical heart valve designs.

## Project Overview

This testing system simulates physiological flow conditions to evaluate:

- Thrombogenicity of mechanical heart valves
- Flow dynamics under pulsatile conditions
- Blood-material interface interactions

## Getting Started

More detailed information about the project setup, testing protocols, and usage guidelines will be added as the project develops.

## Technical Specifications

Detailed technical specifications and setup instructions will be provided in future updates.
